üëã Hey there, I am Ilyass Elfouih from Morocco üá≤üá¶ . I consider myself a Sr Angular/NestJS developer. I love taking challenges and build complicated apps that can scale and most importantly has a good impact on peoples day to day life.

### Here is my little story :

From that little joy feeling when I saw for the first time ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù printed on the screen, to the pride and fulfillment felt after achieving complicated software , the passion for innovation and challenging myself every single day kept driving me to do the best and look for the best. 

Wasting my time following a typical education path with a standard and poor learning that is for most of the time irrelevant to the market needs just to get a diploma ?? No way !
I growth hacked the education system which I felt so slower for my capabilities and my learning pace. This came with a lot of long sleepless nights, thousands of hard working hours and continuous training sessions by the best software engineering geeks. 

Diving in the clients problems and solving them, developing new features, learning new skills, permanent improving while keeping an eye on the world‚Äôs best practices is a typical day in my life.

Sharing my passion and knowledge with local and international community is a mission that I take seriously with a high level of engagement.

My focus now is on javascript frameworks which are **Angular**, **Nestjs** and **Ionic**.
Those frameworks enables me to solve complicated digital problems with reactive and efficient way for me and for my clients.
